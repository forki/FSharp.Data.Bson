Apiary Provider

The Apiary Provider library (`ApiaryProvider.dll`) contains a type provider for calling REST APIs based on the
[apiary.io](http://apiary.io) service. If you host a documentation for your REST API
at apiary and your REST API follows standard patterns, you can easily call it using
the type provider.

### Library license
